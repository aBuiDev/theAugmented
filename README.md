### Development, Purpose & Scope
<br>

* **Description:** <br>
The Augmented is a text-based game that will prompt users to make emotionally driven decisions that will affect the story's outcome. The Augmented is an action RPG set in the year 2088 where humanity has begun to advance the technologies of being able to transpose machine with man via body augmentations. The Augmented universe is based loosely on Eidos' original Deus Ex PC game. The Augmented will take place in New York, on Staten Island - after highly trained and highly advanced unknown terrorists destroy the statue of liberty. The player will take on the role of Agent Caddel, a highly trained and heavily augmented CIA agent - because his body is now over 75% machine, he also fights an internal battle of self-discovery and self-identity.
<br>

* **Problem:** <br>
Many games created today have a main focus on graphics and gameplay only. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, it can sometimes overshadow the story-telling aspect of games. A game rich in an engaging story, much like a movie affords users/viewers to forget about the visuals and focus entirely on the characters and plot. The Augmented is a terminal only application that is limited to text and ASCII; the focus is entirely on the user's connection with the story and the characters.
<br>

* **Target Audience:** <br>
As this is a terminal application, the target audience is for people who have a solid grasp of computer fundamentals, including software engineering students and teachers. Set user interaction and/or player controls will be intuitive via the usage of prompts and simple text, which means most people will be able to play the game. Accessing and running the application will limit users to people with intermediate computer knowledge.
<br>

* **Target Audience Usage:** <br>
Users are to access the terminal application via a terminal client, i.e. Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt/Powershell on Windows, or GitBash. Users will need to have Ruby installed on their computers as well as enough knowledge to run the terminal application using: ```$ ruby the_augmented.rb```. Once the application is running, affordances will be set by the developer to allow users to already understand how to interact with the application when prompted.

### Feature List
<br>

* **Feature I:** <br>
Users can select from two different character classes. Each with different abilities and attributes, and each will impact The Augmented's story. This also includes letting the user set the main character's first name.
<br>

* **Feature II:** <br>
Users can navigate through the story and different locations via prompts. This will give users options of what they can do in the area or what to do next.
<br>

* **Feature II:** <br>
A final turn-based boss fight that will use Ruby's .rand() method to select what attack the final boss will use randomly, the user won't know what the attack will be and will have the option to choose from three different attacks or defences. If the boss counters the attack/defence, then the user will sustain damage and lose hitpoints. If the user's option counters the bosses attack, the user is given a chance to counter-attack and therefore able to do damage to the boss.

* **Intended Gem List:** <br>
    - Ascii Art
    - Tables
    - Prompts
    - Coloured Text
    - Rspec

### Help
<br>

1. Open a terminal / CLI.
2. Navigate to or create a directory you want "The Augmented" to be installed.
3. Once in that directory, run ```git clone git@github.com:aBuiDev/the_augmented.git``` to clone a copy of "The Augmented" onto your computer.
4. Before application can run, user must run 'gem install' to require application dependencies.
